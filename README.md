# PermutationZScoreClustering
 
SpectralClustering.jl contains an implementation of the spectral clustering algorithm described in http://ai.stanford.edu/~ang/papers/nips01-spectral.pdf.  
Duplicate.jl contains the code to convert a set of Z-Scores to a probability distribution over permutations and code to compute the distance between those distributions via their Fourier transform;  the library SnFFT can be used to take those transforms.
